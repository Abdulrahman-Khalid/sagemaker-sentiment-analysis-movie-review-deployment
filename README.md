## 📝 About This Course
### 🌟 Updating a Model

In this project, you will train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model using Amazon
SageMaker on AWS. This model will be trained to do sentiment analysis on movie reviews (positive or
negative reviews). You’ll build the model, deploy it, and create a gateway for accessing this model from a
website.
